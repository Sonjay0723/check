# check
A C program which evaluates one argument that can have either logical or arithmetic. The argument can have multiple expressions, separated by a semicolon. The program takes each expression in the argument and determines whether it is arithmetic, logical, or neither based on if one of those operators are present in the expression. It then goes through a function to check if the expression is valid, which means there is an operand followed by an operator followed by another operand and then ending. If it doesn't follow this format, than errors are displayed based on what the error is.
